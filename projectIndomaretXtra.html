          <h3>Project overview</h3>
          <h4>Product Explanation</h4>
          <p>
            Klik Indomaret Xtra is an online shopping application that offers a
            variety of daily necessities, ranging from food and beverages to
            health and beauty products. In this case study, I will analyze the
            Add to Cart process within the application, which is a critical step
            in the user shopping experience. For this study, I use the Hybrid
            Double Diamond method combined with Design Thinking, which consists
            of four stages: Discover, Define, Ideation, and Deliver. The goal is
            to accelerate solution iterations by ensuring that every design
            decision is based on user data and real feedback, resulting in
            better, tested, and user-centric solutions.
          </p>
          <h4>Duration</h4>
          <p>The duration for planning this project is 2 weeks.</p>
          <h4>My Role</h4>
          <p>UX Designer, UX Researcher</p>
          <h3>Discover</h3>
          <p>
            In this phase, I conducted direct interviews with Klik Indomaret
            Xtra app users via Google Meet. The purpose of these interviews was
            to gain a deeper understanding of the user experience during
            shopping, particularly regarding the Add-to-Cart flow. Through these
            interviews, I was able to explore the problems or obstacles users
            encountered and gain firsthand insights from their perspectives
            about the process of searching for items, adding items to the cart,
            and what happens after items are added to the cart.
          </p>

          <h4>Interview</h4>

          <img
            src="asset/image/interviewxtra.png"
            alt=""
            style="margin-top: 20px"
          />

          <h4>Here are the questions I posed to users during the interview:</h4>

          <p>
            1. How has your experience been using the Klik Indomaret Xtra app
            for shopping for daily necessities?
          </p>
          <p>
            2. How often do you use this app to buy multiple items at once? Do
            you find the process easy or challenging?
          </p>
          <p>
            3. How do you usually search for products in this app? Do you prefer
            using the search feature or browsing through categories? Why?
          </p>
          <p>
            4. When using the search feature, do the results match your
            expectations? If not, which aspects do you think need improvement?
          </p>
          <p>
            5. When adding a product to the cart from the search page, how do
            you confirm that the item was successfully added?
          </p>
          <p>
            6. Have you ever felt unsure whether a product was successfully
            added to the cart after pressing the '+' button? If yes, what made
            you feel uncertain?
          </p>
          <p>
            7. What do you think about the experience of adding items directly
            from the search page? Does this feature make it easier for you, or
            is there room for improvement?
          </p>
          <p>
            8. When adding a product to the cart from the search page, how do
            you confirm that the item was successfully added?
          </p>
          <p>
            9. If there is missing information, does it affect your decision to
            add the item to the cart? If yes, how does it impact your shopping
            experience?
          </p>
          <p>
            10. What are your thoughts on the placement of the 'Add to Cart'
            button on the product detail page?
          </p>
          <p>
            11. When adding products to the cart from the product detail page,
            does the process run smoothly? Have you ever encountered something
            unexpected?
          </p>
          <p>
            12. What are your thoughts on the placement of buttons for
            increasing, decreasing, or removing items in the cart? Are these
            buttons easy to find and use?
          </p>
          <p>
            13. Have you ever accidentally changed the quantity of an item or
            removed it from the cart? If yes, can you describe when this
            happened and how you corrected it?
          </p>
          <p>
            14. How do you feel about the total price displayed in the cart?
            Does it always match your expectations, or have there been
            discrepancies that prompted you to double-check?
          </p>

          <h4>Observation of Reviews</h4>
          <p>
            In this phase, I observed user reviews of the Klik Indomaret Xtra
            app available on the Google Play Store. These reviews provided
            valuable data about real-life problems faced by users, which might
            not always surface through interviews alone. By gathering and
            analyzing these reviews, I was able to identify common complaints
            frequently expressed by users. This method complements the interview
            findings, offering broader insights into user experiences and
            helping to uncover pain points that might otherwise be overlooked.
          </p>

            alt=""
            style="margin-top: 20px"
          />

          <h3>Define</h3>
          <p>
            After conducting interviews and observing reviews, I proceeded to
            the Define phase, where the insights gathered from users were
            organized using an Affinity Diagram. The purpose of this step is to
            group similar findings and identify patterns in the problems most
            frequently experienced by users. This phase helps in formulating the
            key issues that need to be addressed. By clustering related
            insights, the Affinity Diagram reveals clear themes and priorities,
            serving as a foundation for designing targeted solutions that
            address the core challenges faced by users.
          </p>
          <img
            src="asset/image/Afinity Diagram.jpg"
            alt=""
            style="margin-top: 20px"
          />

          <h4>
            From the results of the Affinity Diagram, I identified five main
            user problems, which include:
          </h4>
          <p>
            1. Lack of stock information: Users hesitate to add items to their
            cart due to uncertainty about product availability.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. Insufficient visual feedback after pressing the "+" button: On
            the search page, users often feel unsure whether an item has been
            successfully added to the cart.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Delete button placement: The delete button is positioned too
            close to the product in the cart, leading to frequent accidental
            item removal by users.
          </p>

          <h4>
            Next, I used How Might We to explore as many solutions as possible
            to address the problems faced by users. Based on the Main User
            Problems identified in the Define phase, I created the following 3
            How Might We questions:
          </h4>
          <p>
            1. How might we ensure that stock information is always accurate and
            up-to-date?
          </p>
          <p>
            2. How might we provide clear visual feedback when an item is added
            to the cart from the search page?
          </p>
          <p>
            3. How might we redesign the placement of the delete button and
            quantity controls to prevent users from accidentally removing items
            from the cart?
          </p>
          <h3>Ideation</h3>
          <p>
            In the Ideation phase, after identifying the main issues through the
            Define process, the next step is to generate various creative
            solutions that focus on improving the user experience. This process
            involves several steps to test and visualize the generated ideas,
            with the goal of finding the most effective solution. During this
            phase, the focus is on brainstorming, sketching, and prototyping
            potential solutions to address the problems identified in the
            previous phase. By exploring multiple ideas and refining them, we
            aim to develop solutions that are both user-centric and feasible to
            implement.
          </p>
          <h4>Here are the steps that will be taken in the Ideation phase:</h4>
          <p>1. Brainstorming HMW (How Might We).</p>
          <p>2. Lo-fi Prototyping & Wireframe.</p>
          <p>3. Testing.</p>

          <h4>Brainstorming HMW (How might We)</h4>
          <p>
            How Might We memastikan informasi stok barang selalu terakurat dan
            up-todate?
          </p>
          <p>
            How Might We memberikan feedback visual yang jelas saat barang
            ditambahkan ke keranjang dari halaman pencarian?
          </p>
          <p>
            How Might We mendesain ulang letak tombol hapus dan kontrol
            kuantitas agar pengguna tidak secara tidak sengaja menghapus barang
            di keranjang?
          </p>

          <h4>Lo-fi Prototyping & Wireframing</h4>

              >Wireframe</a
            >
          </p>

          <h4>Testing</h4>
          <p>
            In this phase, I conducted moderated testing based on the previously
            identified "How Might We" questions. The testing process revealed
            that the implemented solutions effectively addressed all user
            concerns and questions. The testing outcomes demonstrated that the
            proposed improvements were well-aligned with user needs, resolving
            pain points such as stock information accuracy, clear visual
            feedback, and optimized button placement. This validation confirms
            that the solutions enhance the overall user experience and meet the
            goals set in the earlier phases.

          <h3>Delivery</h3>
          <p>
            In the final phase, Delivery, my focus was on refining the results
            from the previous testing and ensuring that the application provides
            the best possible experience for users. This was achieved by
            designing High-Fidelity Prototypes, which represent the final,
            polished version of the solutions.
